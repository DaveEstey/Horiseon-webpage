# Horiseon-webpage

## Decription

This project was used to better skills with Semantic HTML and integrating proper CSS into the code. replaced all the <div> elements with semantic elements to have googles search engine prioritize the website as well and make it easier to read for other programmers. I learned that sometimes you need to break code before you can fix it.
